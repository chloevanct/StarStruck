What does music mean to us? 
- Identity
- Social and cultural connection
- Artistic and personal expression
- Emotional and psychological well-being

Our platform offers an immersive exploration experience with your favorite artists. By including favorite celebrities and a personal touch to the discovery of new music, we aim to initiate conversations and build stronger connections, beyond just a curated playlist.

We encourage individuals to explore new and unfamiliar sounds. We strive to support the journey of discovering new emotions and experiences to improve overall well-being.

Using HTML, CSS Javascript, and Spotify API, we built a functional website where users can enter favourite artists to receive a compatibility report with musicians who have similar music taste along with a brief biography.

If you are feeling adventurous, the discover page pulls suggestions using Spotify's web API.
